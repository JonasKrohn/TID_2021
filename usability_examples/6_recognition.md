# Recognition rather than recall

Minimize the userâ€™s memory load by making objects, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.

## Examples

### Jonas
My microwave at home has a bad button system. Turning a knob to regulate power and time is fine, but how do you start it then? Press the only button, the clock, right? Wrong - that just starts a process to set the actual time of day on the microwave. Instead, you have to wait some seconds after providing the time and power, and then it starts. But everyone always clicks the button.
